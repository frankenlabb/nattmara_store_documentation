Built with lua, vite + vuetify 3

## User Todo:

1. Make sure to export esx_status GetStatusData - Minimal could be true

	Example on export in esx_status (Client side):

	<code>
	exports('getAll', function()
		return GetStatusData(true)
	end)
	</code>

	Add this export to the config (Config.esx_status_export)

2. If having more statuses than default:
- Make sure to add Icon in Config.lua
- Make sure to add to Locales.lua ["status"]-keys

3. Make sure to have an es_extended version where you are able to use shared_script '@es_extended/imports.lua'
